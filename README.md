# JasperReport
This project is an example of an use of a Report Engine, called iReport. With this Report Design, we can create layouts containing charts, images, subreports, crosstabs and much more. We can access data through JDBC, Hibernate, CSV, and custom sources. Then we also can publish our reports as PDF, XML, XLS, CSV, text or DOCX.
